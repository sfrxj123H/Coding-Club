        <h2>The quiz system help learners understand article(s) and is not designed to be solved harshly. The quiz system is divided into three levels:
            <br><br> - Level 1: Learners would answer three easy questions and would get to next level if two of them were correct.
            <br> - Level 2: Learners would answer five simple questions and would get to next level if three of them were correct.
            <br> - Level 3: Learners would answer seven advanced questions and would complete the quiz if four of them were correct.
            <br><br>If learners failed a level, learners would need to complete the level again. Please note that leaving or reloading the page would lose all progress.
